# Matrix: it allows run the same job in parallel but with different configurations.
Build for multiple OS (linux, windows)
Run integration test with multiple DBs

Real-World Scenario
You want to test your Node.js backend on multiple versions like:
	• Node 16
	• Node 18
	• Node 20

  build-and-test:
    name: Build & Test (Node ${{ matrix.node }})
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [16, 18, 20]        # 👈 Run in parallel for each version

    steps:
      - name: ⬇️ Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: 🟢 Setup Node.js ${{ matrix.node }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}

      - name: 📦 Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
        working-directory: app/backend

      - name: 🧪 Run Linter
        run: npm run lint
        working-directory: app/backend

      - name: 🧪 Run Unit Tests
        run: npm test
        working-directory: app/backend

What Happens Behind the Scenes?
GitHub spins up 3 runners in parallel:

Runner #	Node Version
1	16
2	18
3	20

Same job runs independently in each.
